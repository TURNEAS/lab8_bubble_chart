For this project, I selected Example 5 from the Lab 8 D3 tutorials, which featured a bubble chart using the force packing layout. I was particularly drawn to this example because of its dynamic, visually engaging style and its ability to represent large datasets in a compact, intuitive format. Bubble charts, especially when implemented with force simulations, allow for a more organic arrangement of data, where each entity is spaced naturally based on size and interactivity is enhanced through animation and tooltips.

My redesigned version uses a dataset of global city populations in 2020, which includes data for the top 200 cities. The file CityData_WUP2018_all.csv was uploaded to GitHub and accessed via a raw URL to ensure it would function correctly with D3’s d3.csv() method. I limited the visualization to the top 100 cities to maintain performance and readability while still showcasing a wide range of global urban centers.

One of the key improvements I implemented was adjusting how the population data translates to circle size. In the original version, circle radius was directly proportional to the population, which can visually mislead users since a small change in radius results in a disproportionately large change in area. To correct this, I modified the size calculation so that population is mapped to circle area instead of radius. This makes the size of each bubble more accurately reflect relative population values and creates a more honest representation of scale.

I also customized the tooltip to enhance the interactivity of the chart. When the user hovers over a bubble, the tooltip now displays the full city name, country, and population value formatted with commas and one decimal precision for readability. I used d3.format to cleanly display population figures in millions. The tooltip follows the cursor, ensuring that it’s always visible but not obstructive.

In terms of design, I chose to use D3’s schemeCategory10 color scale to color each bubble based on its country. This adds an extra visual dimension to the data, allowing viewers to quickly identify bubbles from the same region. The hover interaction darkens the stroke around the circle and increases the border width, making it clear which bubble is active.

Another improvement was the layout. I expanded the SVG canvas to fill the entire browser window dynamically using window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight. This ensures the visualization is responsive and utilizes the available screen space, which is especially important when dealing with a dense dataset.

Overall, I selected this chart because it goes beyond a basic bar or line chart and demonstrates the power of D3 for complex, data-driven visual storytelling. The fluid layout, animated force simulation, and interactive tooltips make the chart both informative and engaging. It invites exploration and comparison, encouraging the user to discover patterns across cities and countries. This example highlights how even with minimal styling, D3 can produce professional, powerful visualizations that go far beyond static graphics.
